## About

Hey! My name is Marcus Eisele. I am a working student and developer. At the moment I am member of a small IT team in which my task is to design and implement applications which support and improve the everyday work. Besides that I'm doing my Master Thesis at the <a href="http://www.hcilab.org/" target="_blank">[HCI-Lab]</a> at the University of Stuttgart. The focus of this work is on the possibility of using physical sensors to adapt interactive systems.
